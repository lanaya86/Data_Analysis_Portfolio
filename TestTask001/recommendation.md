#### **Which variation performs better and why**

- **Variation B** demonstrates significantly **higher CTR (6.01%)** compared to Variation A (5.00%).  
- **Profit per click** is also notably higher for Variation B (**2.94** vs **2.43**).  
- These differences are **statistically significant** (p-value < 0.00001), making Variation B the better-performing option in terms of both engagement (CTR) and revenue efficiency (profit per click).

#### **Notable differences across geographies**

- The boxplots of **profit per click** and **conversion rate** across geographies show some country-level variation.  
- However, the general pattern of Variation B outperforming A holds across most geographies.  
- Some countries may exhibit higher variability in conversion rates, suggesting potential for further local optimization.

#### **Whether the A/B test is statistically conclusive**

- The test results are **statistically conclusive** for CTR and profit per click:  
  - Both metrics show strong significance and confidence intervals do not overlap.  
- The **conversion rate proxy** difference is **not statistically significant** (p-value = 0.139), so no clear conclusion can be drawn for this metric.

#### **Recommendations for rollout or further testing**

 **Recommendation:** Proceed with rolling out **Variation B** as it clearly outperforms A on key business KPIs (CTR, profit per click).
